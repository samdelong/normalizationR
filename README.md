# normalizationR

This is an incomplete attempt to implement the normalization described in the 2023 https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/13/3/1971 academic paper entitled "Hyperparameter Optimization of Ensemble Models for Spam Email Detection".

SPECULATION: the normalization steps suggested by the paper may be over-fitted to the https://github.com/MWiechmann/enron_spam_data which may not reflect modern adversarial techniques. 

Feel free to use this as a starting point and send pull requests if you would like to contribute advances.
